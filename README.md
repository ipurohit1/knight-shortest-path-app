How does the web app work? 

The server-side part of the project is handled in the file, index.js, which listens on port 3000 and displays the view in index.ejs.
The file index.ejs, which has the structure of an HTML file but allows for embedded JavaScript code, has the chess board and a button that the user can press to make the server call. index.ejs has another JavaScript file
functions.js that has several helper functions responsible for modifying components of the view.
